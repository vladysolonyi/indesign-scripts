## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Since you want to get those scripts running ASAP, follow these steps:

1. At first let's install the **Basil.js** library. *(The instructions can be found [here](https://basiljs2.netlify.app/tutorials/01-getting-started/))*

Run this Terminal/Console command to link the scripts to the InDesign:
  
**OSX:**
```
ln -s basiljs_PATH Scripts_Panel_PATH
```
**WIN:**
```
mklink /d Scripts_Panel_PATH basiljs_PATH
```

Change `basiljs_PATH` to the path of your basil.js directory (Somewhere here `~/Documents/basiljs`) and `Scripts_Panel_PATH` to the path of your InDesign scripts directory by opening the **Window>Utilities>Scripts** in InDesign, right-clicking the User folder, opening it in finder/explorer.

2. Download the scripts by clicking **CODE>Download ZIP** at the top of this page ‚òùÔ∏è 

3. Paste the scripts into the user folder your **basil.js** directory.

4. Open the Scripts panel in InDesign. In the **User** folder you should see your linked **basil.js** directory.

5. To run the scripts just double-click the one you want to execute.
